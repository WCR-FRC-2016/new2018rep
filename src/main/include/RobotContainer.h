 * This class is where the bulk of the robot should be declared.  Since
 * Command-based is a "declarative" paradigm, very little robot logic should
 * actually be handled in the {@link Robot} periodic methods (other than the
 * scheduler calls).  Instead, the structure of the robot (including subsystems,
 * commands, and button mappings) should be declared here.
